What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git init command creates your repository. First, there are no commits and tracking folders. 
	When you run git status command you see no commited files including in results.   



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Working directory doesn't contain git features. When you run 'git add'

 	is used to see your modifications before add them to main repository.
